Starbucks - This sample attempts to be a complete sample of a message based solution as well as a concrete example of Gregor Hophe's article "Starbucks doesn't use two phase commit.

HeavyLoad - This sample attempts to push the limits of the infrastructure, and can be run as a gauge on your hardware's capacity to perform.

OpenAllNight - This sample attempts to be a long term test of the infrastructure, and can be set to run for a set number of time. It works with the prebuilt services as well, to both quickly test and to put through their paces over time.
