Starbucks
==================

This sample is based on: http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/ramblings/18_starbucks.html

.. note::

    Do not run both the pre-built services and the subscription manager GUI at the same time.
    The GUI has the same services in one WinForm app for the purposes of demoing the code base.
    If both are on they will steal messages from each other.


To Run
"""""""""""""""

Open up ~/Samples/Starbucks/Starbucks.sln

Start the following projects

/Starbucks.Barista

/Starbucks.Cashier

/Starbucks.Customer

Enjoy.
